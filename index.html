      <h3>Introductions</h3>
     
      <p class="ParagraphStyle">Hey what's up guys! It's your boy speed here, and today I'm really excited, to talk about nisha's less rack. I mean he pops off this series, 
        this is the second series of TI, and honestly his performance throughout this tournament has been fantastic and in this series,
        in particular he goes nuts. I mean at 13 he has two kills, two assists and  107 CS as we skip ahead at minute 21! He is 200 CS even though 
        lgd was 5K ahead at this point. He kept his team in the game on one of dota's most Broken Heroes, in the current meta and Sabrina watches!</p>

     <h3>Gameplay demonstration</h3>
     <p class="ParagraphStyle">Gameplay see how he's so damn efficienton the Lush rack, and let's get into it! Also I want to tell you guys that if you've been struggling with 
        solo queue and you're looking to get to the next rank. I'm going be able to help you, like literally with the gamely website.
        I'm going to give you guys guides, that are going to make it unbelievably clear on what you need to do, so if you've been stuck in the solo queue grind.
        I'll see you there so one of the things that always impresses me about top players, but Nisha in particular is his ability to focus on everything at the same time,
        as you'll notice if you really watch this link closely! He can tests basically every single creep, the only ones he won't can test are creeps
        that are literally going under Zeus's Tower, even then he might consider to do, so and so basically like. I don't know it's just so impressive!
        we'll watch a couple of the Waves here every single creep is contested, thatmelee creep contested, this melee creep right bottle actually cancels a bottle charge from 
        nothing,to say get some damage on him stunts largely for the range creep, there taking advantage of the level 2 splitter aggro's back!
        Primarily playing for the water in here uh looking to obviously secure his Lane in that regard picks up a stick from there, he's going look to contest nothing to say
        as the wave goes on Earth Tower once again contesting the melee Creep from here. You would kind of assume that these range creeps aren't really deniable, because
        if of the Zeus queue but he actually hits a stun allowing him to get a deny on the the range creep, which is just insane right and then once again,
        contesting the flag bearer creep so basically he's just always putting pressure, these players at this top level. Just make you feel like garbage, right if
        you can't keep up, you have no chance every single creep is a battle and that's what you know, if you're trying to get to this level as well you kind of
        have to have the same mindset. You have to be the guy who's able to focus on every single individual creep and every single time you can get a free auto
        attack, in which honestly is a hard thing for me to talk about, like when do you specifically Auto attack tip typically.</p>

        <h3>Tutorial</h3>
      
        <p class="ParagraphStyle">When the wave is shoving into the enemy, you have a double wave: or your range creep is still alive and the enemy range creep is dead, that would be often a scenario 
         where you would put that pressure; but either way even as the lane continues to the four minute Mark typically people stop contesting creeps they get distracted bored 
         lose focus, whatever it is they don't really continue to contest all the creeps, but Nisha consistently will stick with it and that is the most impressive thing to
         me about him as a player.</p>

      <p class="ParagraphStyle">His consistency in his aggression in terms of the Cs in the lane, so from there the first thing he does is buys Mata boots, Does of course have a stick this game 
         for the Zeus, but he picks up a very early Mana boots on top of that he actually gets down a deep word for himself, and finds a d Ward on the hill, which is massive
         because it gives a large amount of XP so that's really really huge from there they look for killing the Zeus! Unfortunately don't find it so he's going push out the 
         mid wave and typically as the current state of mid laners, is you're going to push out the mid wave and then Farm the large cam, he actually Stacks this large camp for
         himself multiple times now this triple stack is only from him and that's a pretty cool play. Right obviously you can't stack the small camp anymore, but every single
         minute you can stack this camp and he Farms it at the seven minute Mark which is really smart right. You can stack at 553, then at 6 53 or I think this Camp is 55, so 
         555 655 and then youtake it at seven, and hopefully you get a neutral item. Somehow that is so unlucky actually, that's crazy somehow he doesn't find a neutral item off a 
         triple stack, doesn't get one off that cam either damn. He must be pissed all right he gets the  Tumblers toy and a pig pull all right some retribution, takes the big pole 
         okayactually opting for the pig pull and he disassembles those matter boots to use this one as well so beautiful efficiency consider. It's going bottom but besides
         to say mid here probably going okay, that's a really cool play!</p>
